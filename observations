Interesting observations:
 
CarOwner - CarOwner Entity triggers the creation of two tables
create table CarOwner (id integer not null, name varchar(255), primary key (id))
create table CAR_CAROWNER (CAR_OWNER_ID integer not null, CAR_ID integer not null)
 
 
Person
 
Notice the two Address embedded entities in person, notice the columns aliases
PERSON_PHONES is created from Person (without specific entity definition). One-Many relation. 
PERSON_INSURANCES is created from Person. Notice that  @ElementCollection is used , since insurance is embeddable in Insurance. 
 
Vehicle
Notice the inheritance of FourWheeler and TwoWheeler  classes. A discriminator is defined (DTYPE)  to distinguish between the two objects
